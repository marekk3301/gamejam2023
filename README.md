As you strive to create a thriving exo-planet, you must cultivate the delicate relationship between plants, their roots, and the soil microbiome. With every seed you plant and every crop you harvest, you unleash the power of photosynthesis to transform the hostile environment into a lush and thriving ecosystem. But be vigilant, as you navigate the dangers of the cosmos and monitor the critical oxygen levels, your skills, and strategy will be tested.
